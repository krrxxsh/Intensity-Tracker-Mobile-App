# Intensity Tracker Mobile App

This repository contains the **Intensity Tracker Mobile App**, a tool designed for image analysis powered by OpenCV. The app provides detailed information about images, including:

- Coordinates (X, Y) of points
- Width and Height of selected regions
- Minimum, Maximum, and Average Intensity values

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Analyze images using OpenCV to extract important details.
- **Flexible Image Input**: Select images directly from your File Manager/Gallery or capture a new photo using your device's camera.
- **History Tracking**: Save processed images and their analysis in history for future reference.

## Use Cases

- Quickly inspect image properties for research or technical purposes.
- Maintain a history of analyzed images for comparisons or documentation.
- Useful for engineers, students, and anyone needing quick pixel/intensity info from images.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV** for image processing.
- Native mobile technologies (please specify Android/iOS and frameworks if relevant).
